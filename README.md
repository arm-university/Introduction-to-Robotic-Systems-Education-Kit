## About
Welcome to our Introduction to Robotic Systems Education Kit!

Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and computer science subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Our Introduction to Robotic Systems Education Kit teach your students to develop autonomous mechatronics and robotic systems. A full description of the education kit can be found [here](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/introduction-to-robotic-systems).

 ## Kit specification:

* A full set of lecture slides, ready for use in a typical 10-12-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below)
* Lab manuals with solutions for faculty. Labs use low cost, powerful hardware boards
* **Prerequisites:** Basics of programming in C, Python and basic knowledge of circuit design

## Course Aim
To produce students with a solid introductory knowledge on robotics and key practical skills required to program and control a robot to interact with its environment and perform simple manoeuvres.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course contains references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. 
 
Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.

------------------------------

In this material, we use the terms ‘Controller’ and 'Target' in the context of the Ros Master and Slave APIs, instead of the terms ‘Master’ and ‘Slave’, which were conventionally used until recently. As a result, the related concepts of 'ROS Master' become 'ROS Controller' and 'ROS Target'. This is not reflected in the code examples, which will be changed as soon as we are aware of any official change.
